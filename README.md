# Grand PY
Projet 7 OpenClassrooms

This repository contains the source code that I use for my NÂ°7 project presentation.

You want to know something related to a place. Ask Grand Py ! But be kind to listen gently when the answer is longer than u expected.

# Features:

The user is on a web page that shows him an empty area (which will be used to display the dialog) and form field to send a question.

The user write a question to grand Py in a natural way and press [enter].

Grand Py gives the user a personnalised answer and give the adresse of the place and then shows a map with a marker the exact location. Finaly, he gives an anecdote about this place.  

The user can then aks him a new question if he wants.
